## Get started

Firstly you will need to install chunky-cli and have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/) 8~ installed in order for the cli to correctly install

```
npm i -g chunky-cli
```

After that if you type: **chunky** in your terminal a list of commands should appear, if so you're all set!

## That's it your first step into becoming a **Product Developer** is done.

## Now let's setup your **Product**

First e want to initialize our product. We are going to do this by writing the following in the command line:

```
chunky init my-product
```

This will create 2 files for you: package.json & chunky.json

To setup our **Chunky Product** we need to do:

```
chunky install
npm install
```

This will install the required files and dependencies.

Now we can just start our web Product:

```
chunky start web
```

Our Web Product should be available at: **localhost:8082**

### Now let's look at our components to do see what Chunky got in his bag
