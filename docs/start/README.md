# Quick Start Guide

#### Prerequisites

Chunky requires Node.js 8. If you don't have Node.js 8 installed, [install it now](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/). Full support for Node.js 10 and beyond is in the works in future versions of Chunky.

*Windows Only* If you're running Windows, make sure you also install [Windows Build Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools).

### STEP 1

Once you have Node.js 8 installed, you're ready to get the Chunky CLI on your machine:

```console
npm i -g chunky-cli
```

Great stuff! Now you should be able to type ```chunky help``` and you should see a beautifully detailed list of instructions.

### STEP 2

Ready to create your first Chunky Product? You're one single command away:

```console
chunky init
```

Take a look inside your current working directory - that's your brand new shiny Chunky Product. Congrats!

### Step 3

Because every Chunky Product is a Node.js module, we need to install the Node.js dependencies. Chunky does that for you with a single command:

```console
npm i
```

### STEP 4

This is great! One more step - ready? Just type the following to see your Web app in action:

```console
chunky start
```

And that's all there is to it. You've just created a full stack product from scratch and you just saw it in action.

How long did that take for you? Hopefully not more than a few short minutes.
