# Features

## Product Oriented

Chunky helps you focus on the Product rather than just on the code. On the The What of the Customer Experience rather than just on The How of the implementation. It accomplishes this by hiding the wires of much of the technical details so you can spend your time creating real Customer Value.

## Full Stack

The true power of Chunky is it works across platforms, including mobile, web, desktop, cloud and blockchain. Every Chunky Product includes Native iOS and Android Apps, a Static Web App, a Desktop App, a Serverless Cloud Backend and a Smart Contract, all fully integrated, fully owned by you and fully satisfying.

### Web Development

Create beautiful Static Web Apps that you can deploy with ease to your favourite static hosting provider, such as AWS S3.

### Mobile Development

Build native iOS and Android apps that you can easily package and deploy to the App Store and the Play Store.

### Cloud Development

Organize your data with a Google Firebase realtime database and seamlessly use that data by writing simple serverless cloud functions that you can deploy with a single command to AWS Lambda.

### Low Code

You can get started with Chunky with minimal programming experience and you can build beautiful products with only a few lines of code. Make no mistake though, Chunky is highly flexible and so if you're an experienced developer, you'll be pleased to find a lot of power and versatility as well.
