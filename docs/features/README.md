## Features

#### 1. Product Oriented

Chunky helps you focus on the Product rather than just on the code. On the **The What** of the Customer Experience rather than just on *The How* of the implementation. It accomplishes this by hiding the wires of much of the technical details so you can spend your time creating real Customer Value.

#### 2. Low Code

You can get started with Chunky with **minimal programming experience** and you can build beautiful products with only a few lines of code. Make no mistake though, Chunky is *highly flexible* and so if you're an experienced developer, you'll be pleased to find a lot of power and versatility as well.

#### 3. Full Stack

Chunky **works across platforms**, including mobile, web, desktop, cloud and blockchain. Every Chunky Product includes Native iOS and Android Apps, a Static Web App, a Desktop App, a Serverless Cloud Backend and a Smart Contract, all *fully integrated*, fully owned by you and fully satisfying.

#### 4. Beginner Friendly

The barrier of entry to Product Development is so much lower with Chunky. If you've never written a line of code in your life before, but are willing to start learning, Chunky is **the best place to start** your Developer Journey.

#### 5. Reduced Complexity

A Chunky Product is composed of **reusable chunks of code**, making the product much more easy to understand, debug and maintain. When working with chunks, the clear separation of concerns reduces your workload tremendously.

#### 6. Integrated Toolchain

You don't have to reinvent the wheel and patch together the supporting tools required to get a product up and running. With Chunky, you get mobile and web **packagers out the box**, hot reloading, configurable environments, and so much more.

#### 7. Command Line Interface

Chunky comes with a comprehensive and **beautiful CLI** that sits on your development machine, giving you *access to a wealth of commands*. Whether you want to create a brand new product, run it in development mode, publish it online, or run a report on your database, the Chunky CLI's got you covered.

#### 8. DevOps Friendly

**AWS** and **Firebase** are Chunky's two best friends and it supports a *deep level of integration* with key services such as AWS S3, AWS Route53 and the Firebase Realtime Database. All you need is a your Firebase and AWS credentials and Chunky does the rest.

#### 9. Strong Security

Your sensitive data such as your AWS access keys or other important information is kept in an encrypted vault on your development machine. Chunky allows you to lock and unlock your vault at will to protect your data with the **highest level of security standards available today**.

#### 10. High Order Components

Chunky makes use of wildly popular web and mobile low level component libraries to construct new **configurable components**, that incorporate business logic and can be used on mobile or web apps *right out of the box*.
