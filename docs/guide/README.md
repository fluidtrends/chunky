## Introduction

Let's be honest, building great Digital Products is hard.

Because there's just too much grunt work.

Gluing, plumbing, wiring, configuring, setting up - urgh - being a Software Developer seems more like being a Code Monkey half of the time.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

Fear no more, your Code Monkey days are over.

Chunky was created with one ambitious goal in mind: Simplifying The Software Development Process - to help you enjoy writing code (again).

As a Software Developer you should spend the bulk of your time creating, not doing grunt work. You were never meant to be a code monkey. You were born to create.

On the other hand, Chunky loves being a code monkey. Let Chunky do the grunt work and you just worry about enjoying your life again and build those awesome features you can't wait to get your hands on.

That's what Software Development is all about. Yes, even if you're a brand new developer. As a matter of fact, if you're just getting started in your development career, you're going to love Chunky.

With Chunky you get a Command-Line Interface and from there you install a template that gives a fully functional product, complete with a Web app and a serverless API, and you can even add an iOS app and an Android app, a Desktop app or even a Blockchain app. Oh, and there's so much more. It comes automatically integrated with AWS and Firebase and ... you know what - why don't you have a look yourself and see why others simply love this happy little code monkey.

Ready to enjoy writing code (again)?

Let's do this.

## Features

#### Product Oriented

Chunky helps you focus on the Product rather than just on the code. On the The What of the Customer Experience rather than just on The How of the implementation. It accomplishes this by hiding the wires of much of the technical details so you can spend your time creating real Customer Value.

#### Low Code

You can get started with Chunky with minimal programming experience and you can build beautiful products with only a few lines of code. Make no mistake though, Chunky is highly flexible and so if you're an experienced developer, you'll be pleased to find a lot of power and versatility as well.

#### Full Stack

Chunky works across platforms, including mobile, web, desktop, cloud and blockchain. Every Chunky Product includes Native iOS and Android Apps, a Static Web App, a Desktop App, a Serverless Cloud Backend and a Smart Contract, all fully integrated, fully owned by you and fully satisfying.

## Quick Start
