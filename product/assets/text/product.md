## Product Oriented

Chunky helps you **focus on the Product** rather than just on the code. On the *The What* of the **Customer Experience** rather than just on *The How* of the implementation. It accomplishes this by **hiding the wires** of much of the technical details so you can spend your time creating real **Customer Value**.
