## The Code Monkey You Were Never Meant To Be.

As a Professional Software Developer, your job is to create great Software Products. Big emphasis on **create**. Your ability to create is the single most important factor in practicing your Software Development Profession. If we talk about Developer Performance it all comes down to how well a developer taps into their *creative ability*. Taking your performance as a Software Developer to the next level means **taking your creativity to the next level**. Software Development is a *Creative Process*. The more creative you are in that process, the better Software Products you will create. The problem is that most often than not, you canâ€™t afford to be creative, even if you want to. Most of the time, your creativity as a Software Developer is literally stuck in the grunt work required to just make things work. Being a Creative Developer sounds nice and all but the truth is that you feel more like a Code Monkey.
