## Do you (still) enjoy writing code?

Let's be honest, building great Digital Products is **hard**.

**Because there's just too much grunt work.**

Gluing, plumbing, wiring, configuring, setting up - urgh - being a Software Developer seems more like being a Code Monkey half of the time.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

**Fear no more, your Code Monkey days are over.**

Chunky was created with one ambitious goal in mind: **Simplifying The Software Development Process** - to help you enjoy writing code (again).

As a Software Developer you should spend the bulk of your time **creating**, not doing *grunt work*. You were never meant to be a *code monkey*. **You were born to create**.

On the other hand, Chunky loves being a **code monkey**. Let Chunky do the grunt work and you just worry about enjoying your life again and build those awesome features you can't wait to get your hands on.

That's what Software Development is all about. Yes, even if you're a brand new developer. As a matter of fact, if you're just getting started in your development career, you're going to love Chunky.

With Chunky you get a Command-Line Interface and from there you install a template that gives a fully functional product, complete with a Web app and a serverless API, and you can even add an iOS app and an Android app, a Desktop app or even a Blockchain app. Oh, and there's so much more. It comes automatically integrated with AWS and Firebase and ... you know what - why don't you have a look yourself and see why others simply love this happy little code monkey.

Ready to enjoy writing code (again)?

#### Let's do this.

## Philosophy

> Chunking is “the very lifeblood of the thought processes” ([Miller](#references), 1956, p. 95)

The *core architectural principle* behind Chunky is the concept of **chunking**. Namely, that organizing a Digital Product in smaller **chunks** will improve the Product Development Lifecycle and **your overall performance** and productivity as a Software Developer.

[Proposed in 1956](#references) by George Miller, the concept of chunking is now one of the most established theory in cognitive science. The basic idea is that working memory has a limited capacity of storing and processing no more than 5 to 9 pieces of distinct information. This is commonly known as *Miller's law* today or the so called 7 +/- 2 law.

This idea, that our working memory maxes out at around 7 pieces of information, is core to how we have been learning and communicating over the past 60 years. Think about phone numbers for example. Memorizing 4169237890 is horrible and down right close to impossible. Whereas (416) 923-7890 is much more manageable and the area code, the 416, eventually becomes a chunk in itself.

Chunking has been studied in different areas of cognition but what our platform attempts to do, is to apply it to Software Development. Can chunking help **improve our productivity and performance** as Software Developers? You bet.

Give it a try and see your productivity and performance soar.

## Features

#### 1. Product Oriented ✓

Chunky helps you focus on the Product rather than just on the code. On the The What of the Customer Experience rather than just on The How of the implementation. It accomplishes this by hiding the wires of much of the technical details so you can spend your time creating real Customer Value.

#### 2. Low Code ✓

You can get started with Chunky with minimal programming experience and you can build beautiful products with only a few lines of code. Make no mistake though, Chunky is highly flexible and so if you're an experienced developer, you'll be pleased to find a lot of power and versatility as well.

#### 3. Full Stack ✓

Chunky works across platforms, including mobile, web, desktop, cloud and blockchain. Every Chunky Product includes Native iOS and Android Apps, a Static Web App, a Desktop App, a Serverless Cloud Backend and a Smart Contract, all fully integrated, fully owned by you and fully satisfying.

**Oh, but there's so much more:**
* Beginner Friendly ✓
* Reduced Complexity ✓
* Integrated Toolchain ✓
* Command Line Interface ✓
* DevOps Friendly ✓
* Strong Security ✓
* High Order Components ✓
* Product Templates ✓
* Declarative Data Operations ✓

#### [See the full Feature Tour](docs/features/README.md)

## Quick Start

#### Prerequisites

Chunky requires Node.js 8. If you don't have Node.js 8 installed, [install it now](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/). Full support for Node.js 10 and beyond is in the works in future versions of Chunky.

*Windows Only* If you're running Windows, make sure you also install [Windows Build Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools).

### STEP 1

Once you have Node.js 8 installed, you're ready to get the Chunky CLI on your machine:

```console
npm i -g chunky-cli
```

Great stuff! Now you should be able to type ```chunky help``` and you should see a beautifully detailed list of instructions.

### STEP 2

Ready to create your first Chunky Product? You're one single command away:

```console
chunky init
```

Take a look inside your current working directory - that's your brand new shiny Chunky Product. Congrats!

### Step 3

Because every Chunky Product is a Node.js module, we need to install the Node.js dependencies. Chunky does that for you with a single command:

```console
chunk install
```

![](http://files.carmel.io/media/install-small.gif)

### STEP 4

This is great! One more step - ready? Just type the following to see your Web app in action:

```console
chunky start web
```

![](http://files.carmel.io/media/start-web-small.gif)

And that's all there is to it. You've just created a full stack product from scratch and you just saw it in action.
